# Childhood-adverse-effects-from-orphanhood-UROP
For this project we will use the DHS data from Rwanda, Colombia and Senegal to estimate if households that experience orphanhood are more likely to suffer from adverse effects such as stunting, mortality, vaccination status and malaria. We will use variables such as mother and father dead to work out which children are orphaned.
